# Dynamic Form Builder 

## Overview 

This project is a dynamic form builder application designed to facilitate communication and collaboration among university students for forming study groups. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the application offers a platform for creating, editing, and publishing forms.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
